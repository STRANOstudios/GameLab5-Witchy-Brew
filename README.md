# Witchy Brew

Welcome to the Game Programming Group Project! This repository contains the source code and resources associated with our game.

## Project Description

The game "Witchy Brew" revolves around the concept of a witch managing a small potion shop in her magical hideaway. Players assume the role of the witch and immerse themselves in an engaging and captivating experience as they strive to fulfill customers' requests by crafting magical potions using a variety of ingredients.

In the game, players must skillfully use their deductive abilities to pinpoint the correct combination of ingredients and arrange them in the right sequence. Through a mechanic similar to Mastermind, players receive feedback on their choices, helping them determine which ingredients are correct and in the right position, and which are only partially correct or completely wrong.

Additionally, players can use the money earned from selling potions to renovate and customize their magical hideaway. They can unlock new decorative items and power-ups, such as a helper crystal ball or an oracle, which can be placed inside the room to provide valuable hints on ingredient combinations.

With an engaging storyline, stimulating gameplay mechanics, and the ability to customize their magical space, "Witchy Brew" promises a unique and immersive experience for all players who love fantasy and puzzle-solving genres.

## Installation Instructions

To copy from GitHub and build a Unity project without installing additional files, follow these general steps:

### Clone the Repository:

Open the GitHub repository page containing the Unity project.
Click on the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP" if you don't have Git installed, or use Git to clone the repository if you have it installed.
If you downloaded the ZIP file, extract its contents to a dedicated folder on your computer.
### Open Unity Hub:

Ensure you have Unity Hub installed on your machine. Unity Hub is a management tool for Unity projects.
Open Unity Hub and click on the "Add" button to add a new project.
### Select the Project:

Navigate to the folder where you extracted or cloned the Unity project.
Select the project folder and click "Open" or "Select Folder."
Install Unity Version (if needed):

If the Unity project requires a specific Unity version that you don't have installed, Unity Hub will prompt you to download and install the required version. Follow the prompts to install it.
### Open the Project:

Once the Unity version is installed, click on the project thumbnail in Unity Hub to open the project.
Resolve Dependencies (if needed):

Unity projects may have dependencies or plugins. Check the project documentation or readme for any specific instructions on resolving dependencies. You might need to import certain assets or packages from the Unity Asset Store.
### Build the Project:

Once the project is open, go to "File" -> "Build Settings."
Choose the target platform for your build (e.g., PC, Mac, Android, iOS).
Click on "Switch Platform" if necessary.
Click on "Build" to generate the executable or project files.
### Run the Project:

After building, you can run the project by executing the generated executable or running it directly from the Unity Editor.
These steps should allow you to copy a Unity project from GitHub, set it up in Unity Hub, and build it without needing to install additional files beyond Unity Hub and the required Unity version. Note that specific projects may have unique requirements, so always check the project documentation for any additional instructions.
